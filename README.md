The repository for the backend can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/colesayer/sock_dev_backend">https://github.com/colesayer/sock_dev_backend</a>.

### Description
My Life Socks is a product customization and visualization tool utilizing the power of WebGL. It is being built for my friend's sock company in North Carolina. Eventually, it will be a tool on their product's web site.

In its current state, a user can choose a sock construction (crew and extended crew for now), pick the heel, toe, and top band colors, choose a pre-made design or upload a design of their own, and choose the type of knit. The app updates the 3d model in real time, giving the user a photo-realistic 3d representation of the sock they're creating. Many new features will be added soon.
