This is the frontend for My Life Socks. You must have installed the backend for everything to work. You can find the backend <a href="https://github.com/colesayer/sock_dev_backend">here</a>.

Built with React, Redux, and Three.js. Assets modeled in Blender.

## How to Run

1.  After resolving the <a href="https://github.com/colesayer/sock_dev_backend">backend</a>...
2.  Clone the repo
3.  Change to the cloned directory from your terminal
4.  Run 'npm install'
5.  Run 'npm start'.  If the backend is also running, it will ask you to switch ports. Type 'y' and hit 'enter'.
6.  My Life Socks will run on http://localhost:3001/
7. Customize some socks!
